## Web Presenter
When I began this project, my motivation was to immerse myself in the environment that I work in. I would create my presentations in the language I speak most fluently.

Now that I have put in many hours, I realize that someone has already created the product I had my eye set on. It would be terribly impractical of me to replicate the wheel. So I've decided to drop my personal project and adopt a community project that I can commit to when I find flaws or come up with new ideas.

I have decided to go with [Spectacle][1]

Spectacle seems to have maturity while embracing an interesting feature set.

Some alternatives I considered:

* [RevealJS][2] - Closest competitor
* [Web Slides][3] - Too new but exciting potential and BEAUTIFUL
* [Deck JS][4] - Too mature

I'll be adapting the Fermi theme I created here to Spectacle. That repo can be found [here][5].
